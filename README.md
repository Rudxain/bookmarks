## Documentation

- [List of built-in CLI utilities in Android (all versions)](https://chromium.googlesource.com/aosp/platform/system/core/+/refs/heads/upstream/shell_and_utilities). This is like ["Can I Use"](https://caniuse.com), but for Android shell scripts. This documentation is so obscure that it's hard to find on Google
- [MKSH manual](http://www.mirbsd.org/htman/i386/man1/mksh.htm). Same as above, but **more obscure**
- [Michael Abrash’s Graphics Programming Black Book, Special Edition](https://www.jagregory.com/abrash-black-book)

## Tools

- [OVC](https://onlinevideoconverter.com). [YTDL](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) is better, but OVC can slice/crop at timestamps
- [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web)

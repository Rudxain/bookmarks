Unlike typical browser "favorites"/"bookmarks", most of these links are _infrequently_ visited. They're here because they're **too valuable to be forgotten**. A minority of links are simply underrated.

To reduce redundancy, if any of these URLs is included anywhere in my GH-Pages domain or my GH Profile-`README`, they'll be removed from this page.

## Tools
"as-is" are apps usable as-is, for browsers. "Indirect" are non cross-platform software and hardware.

	- [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web)
	- [GD web client](https://gdbrowser.com)
	- [OVC](https://onlinevideoconverter.com). [YTDL](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) is better, but OVC can slice/crop at timestamps before downloading.
	- [Image vectorizer](https://svgco.de)
	- [Try It Online](https://tio.run). A comprehensive collection of interpreters for normal-langs and eso-langs
	- [LAN file share](https://pairdrop.net), and [an alt](https://www.sharedrop.io).
